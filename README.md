---

## **ðŸ“Œ Objective**
To implement K-Means clustering using a synthetic dataset generated with `make_blobs` from `sklearn.datasets`. The goal is to understand the basic working of unsupervised learning by visualizing how data points are grouped into clusters.

---

## **ðŸ§° Tools Used**
- Python
- Scikit-learn (`make_blobs`, `KMeans`)
- Matplotlib

---

## **ðŸš€ Features**
- Generates a synthetic dataset with 3 distinct clusters using `make_blobs`
- Applies K-Means clustering to group data into clusters
- Visualizes the clustered data and centroids using a scatter plot
- Highlights the centroids of each cluster

---

## **ðŸ“Š Output**
- A 2D scatter plot with color-coded clusters
- Cluster centroids shown as yellow dots

---

## **âœ… Conclusion**
This task demonstrates a simple and intuitive example of unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering. By using synthetic data, the clustering behavior becomes visually clear and helps in understanding how the algorithm separates data into different groups based on feature similarity. It forms the foundation for applying clustering techniques to real-world datasets in areas like customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern recognition.
